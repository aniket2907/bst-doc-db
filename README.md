# bst-doc-db
In this project, I have created a binary search tree based database of documents in C. The code also compares the performance of the database to a simple linked list implementation of the same.

bstdb.c and bstdb.h and the main code and header files respectively, in which the BST is actually implemented.
listdb.c and listdb.h are the main code and header files for linked list implementations of the same database for comparison.
database. and database.h are the main code and header files for the generation of the database (set-up).
profiler.c, profiler.h and task2.c are files which implement the testing of the two data structure implementations.
